            <h1>About: LeBron Jordan</h1>
            <p>
                LeBron Jordan is not your average name in gaming and no, he doesn't play basketball (we checked). Despite sounding like the ultimate NBA fusion, LeBron Jordan is all about pixels, not points. A seasoned game reviewer with a passion for storytelling and a temper for bad mechanics, with an approval rating of 2.3 he's built a reputation for brutally honest reviews.
