            <h2>Mindseye... a GTA killer or a pathetic knockoff?</h2>

            <p>Mindsye was a promising development made by former Rockstar developers (the people that made GTA), the game prmoised to rival the ultra popular franchise Grand Theft Auto but as I played through the game I can wholeheartly say, that this is a just a cheap ripoff of GTA. The game feels amazingly lackluster at every step of the way and feels rushed at every corner. When playing through GTA I feel very connected to the characters and story where as Mindseye makes you feel that these characters do not matter in any way shape or form, the characters are very bland, the story is very basic and nothing about this game feels fresh. On top of everything the game launched as a parallel to the Cyberpunk 2047 horror show, bugs everywhere, the game glitching and the overall people refunding the game because of how subpar it is. Mindseye is an insult to the great GTA franchise and I would not spend my money on this garbage.</p>

            <h2>A Great Sequel to a Legendary Franchise, or a Cash Grab?</h2>

            <p>Mario Kart has captured the hearts of gamers for generations and it has been a while since the last instalment in the franchise. Mario Kart World looks to push the boundaries of Mario Kart by giving it an open world aspect, the open world aspect when I played is a great idea, but not flawless. It can feel slow at times and if you ever encounter sand... be ready to slug across for a while. As for the racing it feels like good old Mario Kart, the races are fast-paced, the tracks are incredible and the roster of characters is great. Mario Kart does what it has been doing for generations best, but the experimental aspect with the open world while a step in the right direction, will need some updates before it is perfect.</p>
