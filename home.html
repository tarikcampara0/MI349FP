            <h1>Mindseye... a GTA killer or a pathetic knockoff?</h1>

            <p>Mindsye was a promising development made by former Rockstar developers (the people that made GTA), the game prmoised to rival the ultra popular franchise Grand Theft Auto but as I played through the game I can wholeheartly say, that this is a just a cheap ripoff of GTA. The game feels amazingly lackluster at every step of the way and feels rushed at every corner. When playing through GTA I feel very connected to the characters and story where as Mindseye makes you feel that these characters do not matter in any way shape or form, the characters are very bland, the story is very basic and nothing about this game feels fresh. On top of everything the game launched as a parallel to the Cyberpunk 2047 horror show, bugs everywhere, the game glitching and the overall people refunding the game because of how subpar it is. Mindseye is an insult to the great GTA franchise and I would not spend my money on this garbage.</p>
